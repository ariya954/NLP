    "## Task Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input sentence and a list of indices indicating typo locations, the task is to automatically correct each typo by replacing it with the most plausible word given the surrounding context. The input format consists of comma-separated typo indices followed by the sentence, and the output must preserve the original format while correcting only the specified tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline approach uses a masked language model (`distilbert-base-uncased`) to predict the most likely replacement for each typo using a fill-mask strategy. However, we observed that the highest-probability prediction from the model often does not correspond to a plausible spelling correction, as it ignores similarity to the original typo.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, we incorporated orthographic similarity using the `SequenceMatcher` function from the `difflib` library. This ensures that candidate replacements are not only contextually likely but also similar in form to the typo. This modification significantly improved the dev accuracy from **0.23** to **0.52**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we observed that many correct words were not included in the model’s top-20 predictions. Therefore, we increased the number of candidate predictions (`top_k`) considered during decoding. By increasing `top_k`, the correct replacement was more often present in the candidate list, allowing the ranking function to select it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantitative Results\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Top-k predictions | Accuracy |\n",
    "|--------|------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Baseline | k = 20 | 0.23 |\n",
    "| SequenceMatcher | k = 20 | 0.52 |\n",
    "| Increased k | k = 80 | 0.61 |\n",
    "| Increased k | k = 120 | 0.63 |\n",
    "| Increased k | k = 200 | 0.65 |\n",
    "\n",
    "We also experimented with `k = 300`, but the accuracy did not improve beyond **0.65**, indicating diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qualitative Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example illustrates how increasing `k` enables the correct correction to appear among the candidate predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Output |\n",
    "|--------|--------|\n",
    "| Baseline | flouting of disapproval |\n",
    "| SequenceMatcher (k = 20) | flouting of contempt |\n",
    "| k = 80 | flouting of consent |\n",
    "| k = 120 | flouting of consent |\n",
    "| k = 200 | flouting of convention |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the correct word (“convention”) does not appear among the top-20 predictions, making it impossible to select using the baseline or SequenceMatcher-only approach. Increasing `k` allows the correct word to be considered and selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "These results demonstrate that while orthographic similarity is essential for spelling correction, candidate coverage is equally important. Increasing the number of candidate predictions allows the ranking function to operate over a richer hypothesis space, leading to consistent accuracy gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further improvements beyond **0.65** would likely require using a stronger language model (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`) or modifying the candidate generation strategy. However, model changes were not permitted in this assignment."
