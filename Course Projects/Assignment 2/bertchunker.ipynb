    "### 5) Discussion of Alternative Methods Tried (what worked and what did not)\n",
    "\n",
    "Several modifications were tested to improve the baseline Transformer tagger. Each attempt is described below with the motivation and observed outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Baseline provided model (Dev Score: 90.6238)\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline solution used DistilBERT embeddings and a default token classification head. While the model already provided contextual understanding, its performance was limited by:\n",
    "- subword fragmentation (words split into multiple tokens),\n",
    "- sensitivity to misspellings or rare words,\n",
    "- weak phrase boundary consistency,\n",
    "- BIO transition inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the baseline was not poor, the score indicated that substantial improvement was possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Abandoned CRF layer approach (Dev Score: 90.3732)\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the baseline transformer chunking model, we attempted to integrate a CRF layer on top of the BERT encoder and classification head. The motivation was that CRFs can model dependencies between adjacent tags, which is beneficial for sequence labeling tasks such as chunking, where tag transitions often follow structured patterns. However, this approach did not outperform the baseline. We observed that the CRF was not fully implemented with proper sequence-level optimization. As a result, we decided against using the CRF for future improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Adding noise augmentation (Dev Score: 94.1690)\n",
    "\n",
    "A typo-based augmentation strategy was applied during training. Words were randomly corrupted using:\n",
    "- swap of two adjacent characters,\n",
    "- deletion of a character,\n",
    "- insertion of a random character,\n",
    "- replacement of a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was motivated by the fact that chunking should depend primarily on **contextual grammar patterns**, not exact spelling. Training with small misspellings encourages the encoder to learn robust representations and prevents overfitting to clean token forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification produced a very large improvement and was the most influential single change. It strongly improved robustness and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. Adding an MLP classification head (Dev Score: 94.1910)\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification head was expanded into a multi-layer perceptron:\n",
    "- linear projection to a hidden dimension,\n",
    "- non-linear activation (ReLU),\n",
    "- dropout regularization,\n",
    "- final linear projection to tag logits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification was motivated by the idea that a deeper head can learn more complex decision boundaries and can better separate similar chunk tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "The improvement was small, suggesting that DistilBERT already provides strong features, and the head mainly acts as a lightweight mapper. However, the result still improved slightly and remained stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### E. Ignoring padding during training (Dev Score: 94.2950)\n",
    "\n",
    "During batching, sequences were padded to the same length. Padding tokens should not influence training. If padding positions are included in the loss computation, gradients become noisy and can harm convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this:\n",
    "- padded target positions were assigned `ignore_index=-100`,\n",
    "- NLLLoss was configured to ignore those positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This improved the score by preventing artificial gradient updates from padded tokens. The improvement was moderate but consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### F. Replacing MLP with a mini-Transformer head (Dev Score: 94.3483)\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLP head was replaced with a lightweight Transformer encoder layer (one-layer mini-Transformer). The motivation was that chunking depends on token relationships and phrase-level structure. Even though DistilBERT is contextual, adding a small Transformer head allows the model to refine local correlations specifically for chunk prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification improved performance more than the MLP head, showing that explicit token-to-token refinement at the head level can benefit sequence labeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### G. Improving subword-to-word decoding (Dev Score: 94.5807, best result)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major limitations of Transformer taggers is that tokenization splits words into multiple subwords. The simplest decoding approach is to take the first subword’s prediction as the word label, but this often fails because:\n",
    "- the first subword may be ambiguous,\n",
    "- later subwords may contain stronger evidence,\n",
    "- subword predictions may disagree.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce this error source, the decoding logic was improved by aggregating predictions across all subwords belonging to the same word (e.g., averaging log-probabilities). This produces a more stable and representative word-level decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification produced the largest final improvement and resulted in the best dev score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Error Analysis and Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in the best model, remaining errors were observed in cases such as:\n",
    "- long or complex phrase spans,\n",
    "- ambiguous boundaries where multiple chunk structures are plausible,\n",
    "- rare chunk types (e.g., CONJP, INTJ),\n",
    "- confusion between related phrase categories (e.g., NP vs ADJP).\n",
    "\n",
    "These remaining errors are expected for BIO tagging problems and match the precision/recall breakdown reported by `check.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline DistilBERT chunker achieved **90.6238** on the dev set.  \n",
    "A series of systematic improvements significantly increased performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best-performing configuration included:\n",
    "- typo-based noise augmentation,\n",
    "- improved classification head design,\n",
    "- correct padding masking in the loss,\n",
    "- improved decoding logic for subword-to-word label resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final best development score achieved was:\n",
    "\n",
    "**94.5807**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most impactful improvements were noise augmentation and decoding aggregation, indicating that robustness and correct handling of subword tokenization are critical factors in achieving strong chunking performance."
